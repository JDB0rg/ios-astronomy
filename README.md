# Astronomy

Swift app built using [NASA's Mars Rover API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos) to display images taken by the rovers on Mars. This was a student project built to conceptualize the principles of concurrency. 

- Grand Central Dispatch was used to implement thread safety in Swift
- Implemented a custom subclass of NSOperation
- Built functionality to cancel an active operation
- Set up dependencies between operations
